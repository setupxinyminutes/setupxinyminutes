# About

"Setup X in Y Minutes" is the (unrelated) little sister of the awesome [Learn X in Y Minutes].
Where "Learn X in Y Minutes" teaches you the basics about language X,
"Setup X in Y Minutes" teaches you how to setup everything for language X.
This includes IDEs, text editors, testing tools, package manger, linter and
formatter, etc.

The goal of "Setup X in Y Minutes" is to have for each language X

- a fairly vanilla setup to get started,
- *maybe* more opinionated/specialized setups,
- and *maybe* a discussion about the ecosystem of X.

For each setup there is a `Dockerfile` to recreate the setup.


## Setup via Docker
Each setup for X is accompanied by a `X.Dockerfile`.
The `Dockerfile` reproduces the described setup.
